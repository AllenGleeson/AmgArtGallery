This website is for a general audience interested in art.

- As a user I want to be able to navigate through the artists content. Starting on the home page there are a few selected images that will
- display to the user upon visiting. If the user wants to see more they will go to the gallery to see all the images or the poems section to see the poems.
- If the user enjoys the content then they can go to the contact section and see and about me bio and a link to social media for more content.
